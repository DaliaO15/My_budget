# My_budget
This is just an example of data prepocessing and analysis. I download a .csv file containing some data from a bank account and 
play with it to see what kind of plots could be generated. The raw data looked as follows:

To create some plots with that data, it was necessary to start cleaning it. The function "load_data" prepares everything to be string or float when needed. Then, I just did some group-by and sums to obtain insights for where the money was going and coming. This first plot shows the income and outcome per store/institution, and so on.
